# ðŸš— Car Showroom Payment System (Dart)

This project is a simple **car showroom payment system** built in Dart. It models car sales through classes representing showrooms, cars, and customers. The core logic is implemented in `main.dart`, which acts as the application entry point.

---

## ðŸ“„ File: `main.dart`

### Purpose

This file serves as the **entry point** for the car showroom payment system application. It imports necessary model classes and uses the `CarPaymentSystem` to manage:

- Car Showrooms  
- Cars  
- Customers

---

## ðŸ§¾ Code Overview

The `main()` function initializes the system, sets up showrooms, adds cars, and registers customers. This process simulates a basic flow of managing a showroom's inventory and customer interactions.

## ðŸ§  Function Details

### `main()`

The main function is the first to execute when the application starts. It performs the following tasks:

#### ðŸ”‘ Key Actions:

1. **Initialize Payment System**  
   - Creates a new instance of the `CarPaymentSystem` class to manage the application.

2. **Create Showrooms**  
   - Instantiates two `CarShowroom` objects with attributes like `name`, `location`, and `capacity`.

3. **Create Cars**  
   - Generates multiple `Car` objects with properties such as:
     - Type
     - Model
     - Price
     - Status  
     - Linked Showroom

4. **Create Customer**  
   - A `Customer` object is created and associated with a specific `Car`.

5. **Display Showrooms**  
   - Calls `showAllShowroom()` to list all showrooms and their current car inventory.
